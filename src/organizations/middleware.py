OrganizationMiddleware for BMMS multi-tenant request context.

This middleware sets the current organization on every request based on:
1. Organization code in URL path (/moa/<ORG_CODE>/...)
2. User's primary organization (fallback)
3. Session-stored organization selection

Security Features:
- Verifies user has access to requested organization
- Blocks unauthorized access attempts
- Allows superusers to access any organization
- Stores organization in thread-local storage for models

Design Decisions:
- URL-based organization takes precedence (explicit selection)
- Session persistence for organization selection across requests
- Thread-local cleanup ensures no memory leaks
- Middleware must run AFTER AuthenticationMiddleware
