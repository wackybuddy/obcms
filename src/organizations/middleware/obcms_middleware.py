"""
OBCMSOrganizationMiddleware for BMMS embedded architecture.

This middleware auto-injects the default OOBC organization in OBCMS mode,
ensuring request.organization is always available without URL extraction.

Architecture:
- OBCMS Mode: Auto-inject OOBC (this middleware)
- BMMS Mode: Skip, let OrganizationMiddleware extract from URL

Design Decisions:
- Runs BEFORE OrganizationMiddleware in middleware chain
- Only operates in OBCMS mode (is_obcms_mode() == True)
- Ensures default organization exists on initialization
- Sets request.organization for all requests in OBCMS mode
- In BMMS mode, this middleware is a no-op (pass-through)

    Auto-inject OOBC organization in OBCMS mode.

    This middleware ensures that in OBCMS (single-tenant) mode, every request
    automatically has the default OOBC organization set in request.organization.

    In BMMS (multi-tenant) mode, this middleware does nothing and lets
    OrganizationMiddleware handle organization extraction from URLs.

        1. AuthenticationMiddleware (Django built-in)
