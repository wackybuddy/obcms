## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: How long do I have to complete each workshop?**
A: Your facilitator sets deadlines. Typically 3-7 days per workshop. Check communication from facilitator for specific dates.

**Q: Can I edit my submission after clicking "Submit"?**
A: No. Once submitted, responses are locked. Double-check before submitting. If you need to make changes, contact your facilitator.

**Q: What if I'm stuck on a question?**
A: Try your best. If you truly don't know, write "Not aware of this information" rather than leaving blank. Contact your facilitator for clarification.

**Q: Can I complete workshops out of order?**
A: No. Workshops must be completed sequentially (1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5). This ensures proper flow of information.

### Technical Questions

**Q: My autosave isn't working. What should I do?**
A:
1. Check your internet connection
2. Click "Save Draft" manually
3. Refresh the page to verify your answers are saved

**Q: I accidentally closed the browser. Did I lose my work?**
A: No! Autosave preserves your work. Log back in and continue where you left off.

A: Could be your internet connection. Try:
1. Refresh the page
2. Close other browser tabs
3. Switch to a different browser

**Q: Can I use my mobile phone?**
A: Yes, but **computer/laptop is recommended** for better experience. Mobile works for short text, but longer responses are easier on a computer.

A: **Google Chrome** (recommended), Mozilla Firefox, or Safari. Avoid Internet Explorer.
